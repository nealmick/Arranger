# CSC 110 Final Project - Arranger:

This project was built using the Java library KarelJRobot.  The purpose of this project is to rearrange the dots in ascending order. The dots are inputed by a map file with .kwld extension.  The problem is solved using a bubble sort algorithm.  The algorithm works by comparing the the current column with the next.  If the next column is smaller then the current column then the columns are swapped.  this process is repeated until the dots are ordered.
